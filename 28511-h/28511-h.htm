<h3><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>


<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you will each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice, you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way, you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>

<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word [<i>in</i>] means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while [<i>off</i>] indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
[<i>off, coming in</i>] are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words [<i>mob</i>] or [<i>crowd
noise</i>] you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>In the year 1661 Connecticut received from the hand of
Charles the Second a very liberal charter granting to the
people of the colony almost complete self-government
and to the colony an enormous stretch of territory extending
westward to the Pacific Ocean. For fifteen years the
colony prospered under the generous charter. Then in
1676 trouble arose with the Governor of New York, Sir
Edmund Andros, about the boundary line between the
two colonies. Andros demanded authority over all the
land west of the Connecticut River. Governor Treat of
Connecticut refused to submit. Andros threatened to
seize the disputed land. Treat defied him. Andros fitted
out three ships, embarked a military force, and set out for
Saybrooke, Connecticut. Treat ordered out the militia,
garrisoned the fort at Saybrooke, and waited.</p>

<p>Our first scene is in the fort on the morning of July 9,
1676. The Governor is at breakfast when he hears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Governor! Governor! The ships are coming into the
harbor!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Are you certain they are the ships of Governor Andros?</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Come and see for yourself, Governor.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Come along, then. Lieutenant Allyn, how many ships did
you see? [<i>crowd noises swell up</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Only one, sir. I didn't wait for any more.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Ah, here we are! Give me your hand while I climb to the
ramparts.</p>

<p>There's three of 'em, Governor!
That's Andros, sir. No doubt o' that!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, three! Andros's ships! That's certain! [<i>calling</i>]
Every man to his place! Load your muskets and prepare
for action! Andros shall not land!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, sir! [<i>calling</i>] Throw the cannon across the bow of
the forward ship!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Fire! [<i>a cannon shot</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Oh! Look at it!</p>

<p>Yea! Good shot!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Excellent! That will show Andros our temper!</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>The ship is coming about, sir!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Ahoy, the fort!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Can you see who it is, Lieutenant?</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>No, sir!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>I say there! Ahoy, the fort! Is there anyone there?
Answer or we'll open fire on you!</p>

<p>Hail them, Lieutenant.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN [<i>calling</i>]</p>

<p>Hello there, what do you want?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Is the Governor of Connecticut Colony in the fort?</p>

<p>What shall I tell him?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Tell him I'm here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ALLYN [<i>loud</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, the Governor is here!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Governor Andros sends his compliments&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>under his breath</i>]</p>

<p>Compliments, indeed!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>And requests Governor Treat to come aboard for a parley.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Never! Tell him if Andros has anything to say let him
come here, alone and unarmed, and say it!</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Yes, sir! [<i>loud</i>] Governor Treat's compliments. He requests
Governor Andros to come ashore for a parley.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Alone and unarmed.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN [<i>loud</i>]</p>

<p>If he means no harm, let him come alone and unarmed.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>He'll never come!</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>They're letting a small boat down, sir!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Indeed! Who is in it?</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>A sailor and another&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Andros?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>It may be, I don't know him. They're pulling away from
the side now.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>If that is really Andros, he's a brave man.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Aye, sir, he is that. Will you go down to meet him?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Indeed I will, if he has the courage to come ashore without
a guard! I can do no less than meet him at the shore.
Come along, Lieutenant. [<i>calling</i>] Stand by, men, ready
for action at any moment! Lieutenant Allyn and I are
going out to meet the Governor!</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Through this portal, sir! I've unlocked it.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>The boat is just beaching, sir.</p>

<p>Good! And here he comes.</p>

<p>Alone!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Have I the honor of greeting Governor Andros?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS [<i>coming in, storming angrily</i>]</p>

<p>What is the meaning of this, sir? What is the meaning of
this?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I beg your pardon?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>This&mdash;this show of force? What is the meaning of it, I
say?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Sir! This force is here to maintain the rights of this colony
against the illegal aggression of New York!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Where is your Governor?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Here!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Well, Governor, I'll have you know that I have come here
in the legal performance of my duties to take command
of land legally and lawfully a part of the possessions of
His Grace, the Duke of York.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I have already informed you, sir, that you shall not have it!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Is this rebellion?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>It is not, I assure you. But we will hold this land which is
ours by right of grant from His Majesty, Charles the Second.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>My commission as Governor of this territory comes directly
from His Grace, the Duke of York.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>His Grace has no jurisdiction here.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Here, sir, are my orders. [<i>rattle of paper</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>And here, sir, is a true copy of our charter. [<i>rattle of
paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>My orders supersede your charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Our charter is a royal grant, and cannot be superseded except
for cause by due process of law.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I shall take possession under my orders. You can appeal
to the Privy Council for redress.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>You can take possession only after every man in this fort
is dead!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Do you still insist on this ridiculous show of force?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I do! If you make a move to land your troops, we will
open fire!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Very well. I shall report to His Grace that I was prevented
from obeying his command by an unwarranted and illegal
show of force!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>And we shall report to His Majesty that we defended our
rights under our royal charter.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Confound your charter! I'll see to it that you lose it!
Good day, sir.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Good day!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So Governor Andros took his departure without gaining
possession of the territory he claimed. For the next ten
years Connecticut continued in undisputed possession of
her charter, and then on December 19, 1686, Andros was
appointed Governor of all New England. News of this
appointment reached Connecticut several months later.</p>

<p>Our next scene is at the State House in Hartford. It is
June of 1687. The General Court of the Connecticut
Colony is in session. As our scene opens, Governor Treat
is addressing the Assembly.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Gentlemen! I have called you here to consider a matter
of grave importance to the life of this colony. As you
know, His Majesty has seen fit to deprive us of our rights
under our charter and has appointed a Governor who is
to have supreme power over this colony and all of New
England.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Your Excellency&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, Captain Wadsworth?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Let us not submit! Let us appeal to the Privy Council!
We have our rights under the charter.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Yes, yes! Let us not submit!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>It is useless, gentlemen. When we are ordered to submit,
we must submit or be in rebellion.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>When may we expect the order?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I was informed this very morning that an officer of Governor
Andros was on his way here to take over the government
of the colony, and we might expect him this very
day.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Then what can we do, sir?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>We can submit&mdash;indeed we must submit to the rule of
Governor Andros, but, gentlemen, we must not relinquish
our charter!</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>No, no! We must save our charter. [<i>etc.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But how can we save it? If I am ordered to give it up,
what can I do? I have it here. It is in my possession. How
can I hold it against an order to relinquish it?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Your Excellency, if it is not in your possession, you cannot
give it up.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But it is, Captain Wadsworth.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Then, sir, I move you that this Assembly forthwith take it
out of your possession and intrust it to a committee for
safe-keeping.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, that is possible.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>You have heard the proposal. Those favoring&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Opposed&mdash;it is a vote. Will someone propose the committee?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Your Excellency, I propose Captain Wadsworth, Charles
Willys, and John Talcott.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But Talcott is not here.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>All the better, sir, since we cannot give up the charter except
upon unanimous consent of the committee.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>A very good arrangement. Is there a second to the nomination
for the Charter Committee?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second! [<i>loud knock</i>]</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Don't open until we have had the vote! All favoring&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye! [<i>knocking</i>]</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>outside</i>]</p>

<p>Open, in the name of the King!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Opposed? Carried!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>insistent knocking</i>]</p>

<p>Open, open, I say! Open in the name of the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>over the noise</i>]</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth, I deliver this charter into your hands
for safe-keeping.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>We shall keep it, sir. Never fear!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>calling</i>]</p>

<p>Doorkeeper, open the door!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>What is the meaning of this, sir? Why was I locked out?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Your pardon, sir. But what authority have you, sir, to
break into the Assembly of the General Court of Connecticut?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>I have come to take over the government of this colony
under the authority of Governor Andros.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Indeed, and who are you, if we may be permitted to
know?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Ah, of course&mdash;I have the honor to be Samuel Bligh,
Colonel in His Majesty's service. Are you Robert Treat?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Here are your orders! [<i>rattle of paper</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Thank you. "Hereby ordered"&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;"in compliance
with mandate of His Majesty"&mdash;yes, indeed.
Colonel Bligh, we are ready to turn the government over
to Governor Andros.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Then, sir, you will deliver up the charter to me.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>The charter! The charter&mdash;read the rest of the order,
sir.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>reading</i>]</p>

<p>"Governor Treat is hereby ordered to deliver up the forfeited
charter"&mdash;but, Colonel Bligh, I cannot deliver up
the charter&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Because, sir, it is not in my possession.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>In whose possession is it?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>It has been intrusted by the General Court to a special
committee.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Indeed&mdash;and who comprises the committee?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The clerk will read the names of the committee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>May it please you, sir, the committee consists of Captain
Wadsworth, Charles Willys, and John Talcott.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Are any of those named here?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Your name, sir?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth, I order you to deliver up the charter
to me.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Oh, yes, and have you an order for it there?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Indeed I have. Governor Treat has just read it.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>May I be allowed to see it?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Of course. Governor Treat, will you let this gentleman
read the order and be satisfied.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p>Hm, yes.&mdash;"Governor Treat&mdash;hereby ordered"&mdash;but,
Colonel, this is an order upon Governor Treat!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Of course it is! Now are you satisfied?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I am deeply sorry, sir, I do not see how the committee can
comply with this order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Why not, pray&mdash;is it not properly signed and sealed?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Oh yes. Signed properly, but it is drawn against the Governor&mdash;and
not against the Charter Committee.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Why&mdash;what&mdash;oh, this is too much! Governor Andros
warned me that you would be stubborn and stiff-necked!
But I'll have that charter! Here&mdash;I'll change that order&mdash;give
it here!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Here you are, sir. [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;yes&mdash;a quill. So&mdash;now&mdash;"The Charter Committee&mdash;is
hereby ordered"&mdash;there you are. Now I
hope you are satisfied.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Are you satisfied with this, Governor?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;does this not seem to be a forgery, Captain Wadsworth?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>It not only seems to be, sir, but it is. I saw him make an
illegal change in the order. All of us saw it.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Yes, yes! We saw him.</p>

<p>It is a forgery! Don't obey it!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I should say that the change invalidated the entire order!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>What? You are trying to put me in the wrong?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Not at all, sir! You have put yourself in the wrong.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>But&mdash;but&mdash;you forced me to make that change in the
order.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I believe, Colonel, we merely pointed out that your order
was inadequate; we did not force you to commit forgery.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Oh, this is a trick! This is a trick! I demand the immediate
surrender of the government and the charter!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>What is the will of the Assembly? Can we deliver up the
government under an order which is obviously forged?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>No, no! No indeed!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The vote is against you, Colonel.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Andros will come himself and attend to this affair. I wash
my hands of it! He'll make you pay for this day's work&mdash;and
he'll get the charter! Good day!</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Good day!</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Andros did come, as Colonel Bligh had threatened, but not
for several months. But when he came, he came in state,
with a company of soldiers, two trumpeters, and Colonel
Bligh. He intended this time to get the charter, and no
mistake!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Governor Treat called the General Court to assemble on
the evening of October 31, 1687, to confer with Governor
Andros and make one last determined stand to retain the
charter even if there was no way to retain their rights
under the charter.</p>

<p>Our next scene is at the State House in Hartford. It is
evening. The sexton is preparing the room for the meeting
which is about to take place.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON [<i>to himself</i>]</p>

<p>Now these candles, where'd I best put 'em. I cal'ate
mebbe I'd better scatter 'em around the room&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Good even to you, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Even, Captain Wadsworth. Even, Master Allyn.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Good even, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>These candles, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir! I was jest a puttin' 'em around where everybody'd
git a little light.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I think perhaps you'd best put them all on the Governor's
table.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>The Governor's table. Yes, sir! So&mdash;one here&mdash;and
one&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>No, no, Nathan. Put them all together at this end of the
table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>This end by the window?</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>I think that will be best, don't you, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Of course! The Governor needs a great deal of light.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>But, sir, the draft from the window&mdash;it may blow them
out.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Well, well, if it does, Nathan, we'll just have to light them
all again.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir! Of course, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>low</i>]</p>

<p>Now Allyn, seeing you are the clerk of the General Court,
you can sit at the Governor's table without exciting suspicion.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Yes, Captain!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Best put your chair next the window.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Have you the charter?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Yes, I have it with me, and when Andros demands it I shall
have to produce it.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Andros must not be allowed to get his hand on it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>That will be your duty.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Willys will be waiting outside that window, next your
chair. When the candles go out, grab the charter and toss
it out the window. He'll put it in a safe place.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>You know the oak in front of his house?</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Indeed yes!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>There is a hollow&mdash;high up&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>louder</i>]</p>

<p>Nathan!</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, Captain!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>A good fire you have in the fireplace.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>I figgered to have a good fire&mdash;it's a mite chilly this
evenin'.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>It may get overly warm in here before the meeting is over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Aye.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I want you to stand close to that window behind John
Allyn's chair.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Don't leave it. And the moment I say, "Sexton, it's warm
in here," throw open the window. You understand?</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>"Sexton, it's warm in here," throw it open. Yes, sir, I
understand.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Never mind what anyone else says. Throw it open on my
signal and throw it wide open.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>But the candles, sir&mdash;they may go out. They're right
close to the window.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Never mind the candles.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Never mind them&mdash;yes, sir! [<i>trumpets sound outside</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Here comes Andros. Throw open the door.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Never mind, Nathan. I'll do it. You stay by that window.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>The window. Yes, sir!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Enter, Governor Andros.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Thank you. Governor Treat&mdash;I now call you that for
the last time&mdash;will you show me to my place?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Of course, sir. Captain Wadsworth, will you usher us to
our places?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Right this way, Governor. We have arranged this place
for you.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Thank you. Do we need all the candles here?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>For you and the clerk. [<i>noise and confusion of members
entering</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Yes, yes! Of course! Treat, will you sit at my left?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Thank you, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Will you call the Assembly to order?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Gentlemen, will you take your places. [<i>sound of gavel</i>]
The Assembly will please come to order! [<i>quiet</i>] In accordance
with the command of His Majesty we are met
here to surrender the government of the Connecticut Colony
to the Royal Governor, Sir Edmund Andros. On behalf
of this Assembly, I have the honor, sir, to welcome
you and assure you of our submission to His Majesty's
command. We have ever been a loyal and a law-abiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
people. We surrender the prerogatives of government under
our charter with regret; but His Majesty commands,
and we, his loyal subjects, have nought to do but obey.
We are, sir, yours to command.</p>

<p class="center">ALL [<i>cheers</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Thank you, Master Treat. I am agreeably pleased at the
expression of obedience. In the name of His Majesty I
hereby take command of the colony of Connecticut and
order it joined to the colony of Massachusetts Bay, of
which you shall henceforth be a part. And now, you
have only to surrender the charter to me to complete the
ceremony of submission to the order of His Majesty.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But, sir, we have signified our submission. The surrender
of the charter is quite another thing.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>It was granted in perpetuity, to be forfeited only through
due process of law.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Have you not been informed, sir, that a writ of quo warranto
issued in the proper courts of England was tried and
went by default last February?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Last February? Indeed, sir! We had no knowledge that
any action was brought against it. Who was the complainant?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I was!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>You, sir?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed, you seem to have forgotten an occasion when I
promised you I'd get your charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>No, sir! Unfortunately I still remember it!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I have here the original court order, declaring your charter
forfeit, and I shall now trouble your Charter Committee
to produce the original document.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>One moment, sir. Has not every Englishman a right to
defend his case before a court of law?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;you had such a chance and failed to appear.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>We had no notice of the action.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>That's not my fault.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The court is in error, and we shall appeal.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Appeal all you like; but produce the charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>We do so under protest.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah, very well. I care not how much you protest. Once
I get the charter, I can assure you, you'll never see it again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Produce the charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth, place the charter on the table.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Here it is, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;at last!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>One moment, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>What now?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Will you first sign the receipt for the charter, so that the
committee may be protected?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Why, certainly, if you wish. It's no matter; but I'll do it.
Give me your quill, clerk.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Here you are, sir&mdash;and paper.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Yes. Hm&mdash;"received&mdash;charter&mdash;signed"&mdash;there&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Sexton, it's warm in here!</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir! [<i>noise of window</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Hey, the lights! Quick, what's happened? Lights! Lights!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>The candles have all blown out!</p>

<p>Put down the window!</p>

<p>What's the matter&mdash;[<i>etc.</i>] [<i>exclamations continue
through the scene</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Put that window down! What are you trying to do?</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Why, sir, it was warm.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Put it down, I say! Light those candles! What foolishness
is this? Light those candles, I say! Do you hear me?</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir, at once, sir! [<i>noise of window going down</i>]</p>

<p>Here, sir, I'll light the candles. I'm right sorry, sir. Now,
where did I put my flint? Ah, here it is. There you are,
sir. I'm right sorry I put you out, sir. I didn't think&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Fool! Now, Treat, hand me the charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The charter&mdash;why, sir&mdash;you had it.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Had it? What are you talking about?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Why, sir! I saw you put your hand on it the moment the
lights went out.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed I did not. Give it here!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But, sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Hey&mdash;you&mdash;Captain&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Wadsworth, give me the charter!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>But, sir, I gave it to you.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>You did not!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>But I have here your receipt for it!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Give me back that receipt!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I shall certainly do nothing of the kind, sir. I gave you
the charter; you gave me this receipt for it. I have here
twenty witnesses to the transaction!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I'm being tricked! I say I will have that charter. It's
somewhere here, and I'll have it. [<i>calling</i>] Colonel Bligh!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>distance</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Surround this place with your soldiers. Don't let a single
man leave until he has been searched!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Sir, this is illegal! You have no search warrants!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed! I'll do it whether it's legal or not. I'll have that
charter, I tell you, if I have to search every spot in this
town! I'll have it, I say I'll have it.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>And so the great search began. All that night and into
the next day the Governor, the Colonel, and their soldiers
searched high and low for the missing charter. At last
they came to the house of Charles Willys, in front of
which stood the great oak in which the charter lay safely
hidden.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Who lives here?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>This is the home of Charles Willys!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed! One of the Charter Committee, eh?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Good! Search this place inside and out, Colonel. Don't
leave a thing unturned.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Very good, sir! Search this place, Captain&mdash;thoroughly.
Tear up the floors, dig up the garden, rip the upholstery
off the furniture, but find that charter!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir. Follow me!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Bring out the master of the house. The rest of you back
up against this tree and don't move!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Sir, I protest again&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Protest all you like. It will do you no good until you produce
that charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I don't know where it is. You had it, that's all I know.
If you lost it, it is not our fault.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Silence!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>a little distance</i>]</p>

<p>Here's the master of the house, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah, indeed! Are you Master Willys?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Where is the charter?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>Your pardon, sir, but how should I know?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>You were a member of the Charter Committee, were you
not?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I was!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Then where is it?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I am informed that the charter&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Yes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>Was placed&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>In your hands!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Sir! If you don't tell me where that charter is&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>What then, sir?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Do you see this oak tree?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I'm not blind, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I'll have you strung up&mdash;strung up in it, sir; I'll have you
strung up in it!</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I should hate to have such a fine tree perverted to such a
purpose, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah! You would! Colonel Bligh! Colonel!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>distance</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, Governor!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Send me half a dozen soldiers and a stout rope!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Yes, sir!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah! Now perhaps we'll get something from you. Will
you tell me or will you be hanged by your thumbs from
that stout limb up there until you are ready to tell me
where the charter is?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Governor Andros, I fear you have forgotten yourself in
your rage. Master Willys is entitled to a trial before any
such punishment can be meted out to him.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Silence, or I'll have you strung up with him! Gad, sir,
I'll fill this oak tree with stiff-necked rebellious Connecticut
men, but I'll have that charter!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Here are your men, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Good! One of you climb that oak tree. Here, you, Sergeant.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Give him a hand there. [<i>sound of starting to climb the
tree</i>] Have the men found anything in the house, Colonel?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Not a thing, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Look here, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah, Captain Wadsworth. Have you something to say?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I have, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Speak out.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Tell those men to stay out of that tree and I'll tell you.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>All right, Sergeant, come down. I thought we'd get something
out of them if we scared them. Well, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Sir, you have lost the charter; that is clear.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Where is it?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Just a minute. You have lost it. You also have given us
your receipt for it; therefore you should have it.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>And I intend to have it.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>You can't. I can assure you of that, but here is what I
propose. The committee is willing to turn over the receipt
to you if you will stop this foolish and destructive search
for something you can't find.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Never! Sergeant, go up that tree again. We'll string
these fellows up.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Ah, very well, then. But, sir, you'll look very foolish
when you report to the Privy Council that you did not get
the charter, and we produce your signed receipt!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>What?&mdash;Hm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, Governor. How will you explain that to the
King?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>What? Why! Ah&mdash;very well then, give me the receipt
and I'll leave. After all, your charter will do you no good.
It's revoked.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Exactly! That's a very sensible view to take, Governor
Andros. I congratulate you.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Here is the receipt, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Humph!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>You're very welcome, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Colonel Bligh, draw up your guard and prepare to return
to Boston. [<i>orders and confusion</i>]</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>over the noise</i>]</p>

<p>My congratulations, Captain Wadsworth. A good bargain.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Indeed it was. Another foot up the tree, and the Sergeant
would have had the charter.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Quick step, march!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>By saving the charter Connecticut preserved her claim to
separate government, and in 1694 the King decided that
the charter was in full legal force. It served as the fundamental
order of Connecticut government down to the
Revolution and until 1818, when a new state constitution
superseded it.</p>

<p>The oak in which the charter was so well hidden was called
from that time the "Charter Oak." It stood until August
21, 1856, when it fell. At sunset of that day the bells of
Hartford tolled, and mourning was displayed for the historic
old tree. And today interested tourists may see the
spot where the Charter Oak stood and see a piece of the old
tree in the State House.</p>
